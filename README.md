## Welcome to my Portfolio ##

I'm a junior full-stack developper and I decided to create a portfolio ! 
I had fun challenging myself by using NextJS (https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/getting-started/installation) and Framer Motion (https://motion.dev/)

### What I did ###

In my portfolio there are There are several animations.

For example I did : 
- An image that follow the users mouse
- Hover effect (writing effect) on the nav elements
- Smooth scroll transitions with images using Framer Motion scroll animations (https://motion.dev/docs/react-scroll-animations)
- Underlining and text borders using Framer Motion SVG animation (https://motion.dev/docs/react-svg-animation)
